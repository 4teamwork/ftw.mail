  [lknoepfel]


2.5.0 (2017-05-22)

  [lgraf]


2.3.4 (2015-08-19)
------------------

  again. Includes Upgrade-Step to fix existing objects.
  [lgraf]


2.3.3 (2015-08-03)
------------------

- get_header(): Fix up RFC 2047 encoded words separated by 'CRLF LWSP'
  (which is fine according to the RFC) by replacing the CRLF with a
  SPACE so decode_header can parse them correctly.
  This works around a bug in decode_header that has been fixed in 3.3.
  See http://bugs.python.org/issue4491 and its duplicate.
  [lgraf]


2.3.2 (2015-06-30)

  [jone]

  [jone]

  Also change the lawgiver hint to ingnore this permission.
