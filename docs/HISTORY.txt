  trouble during upgrades caused by caching weirdness.
  [lgraf]


2.3.4 (2015-08-19)
------------------

- Make sure message.contentType is stored as `str`, not `unicode`. Otherwise
  this will result in "Wrong contained type" when trying to save the object
  again. Includes Upgrade-Step to fix existing objects.
  [lgraf]


2.3.3 (2015-08-03)
------------------

- get_header(): Fix up RFC 2047 encoded words separated by 'CRLF LWSP'
  (which is fine according to the RFC) by replacing the CRLF with a
  SPACE so decode_header can parse them correctly.
  This works around a bug in decode_header that has been fixed in 3.3.
  See http://bugs.python.org/issue4491 and its duplicate.
  [lgraf]


2.3.2 (2015-06-30)

  - Cache attachment infos on mail object.
  - Cache headers for tabbed view.

  [jone]

- Make sure only a *default* value will be set for IMailSettings.mail_domain,

2.0 (2013-10-21)
----------------

- Make mail tab date parsing robust.
  [jone]

- Disable sorting in mail tab for header information columns.

  Also change the lawgiver hint to ingnore this permission.
